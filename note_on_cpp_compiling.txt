All of the code in "\MY CODE data structures and algorithms\*" is built with cmake. 

here is the contents of the CMakeLists.txt(its the same for every single .cpp file so far):

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(cpp VERSION 0.1.0)

set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)

include(CTest)
enable_testing()

add_executable(cpp main.cpp)

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
